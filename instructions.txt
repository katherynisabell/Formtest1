Fun with Forms

Also prompt for a sentence. Below the sentence input display two radio buttons:

All Letters (default)
Vowels Only
Display the user's name the proper number of times. One name per line.

Display the sentence and the value of the radio button.

Extra Credit: Display the number of letters in the sentence or the number of vowels in the sentence.
